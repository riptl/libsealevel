 * libsealevel is a C interface for the Sealevel virtual machine.
 * This version of the library bundles the interpreter and JIT executors part of the Rust implementation of the Solana blockchain.
 *
 * Source code: https://github.com/solana-labs/solana
 *
 * ABI stability is planned, though this version makes no promises yet.
 * Avoid passing objects between two different versions of this library because no internal compatibility guarantees are made.
 *
 * Note that, despite the Rust code under the hood, this interface allows unsafe behavior.
 * The usual C rules apply library-wide: Check for null pointers, avoid aliasing, don't mix types, respect thread safety, no double frees.
 * You may find additional safety remarks on each exported function.
